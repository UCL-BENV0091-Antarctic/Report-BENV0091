\section{Contributions} %1.3
The contributions of this thesis are summarised as follows: 
\begin{itemize}
  \item We analysed multiple factors influencing the sea ice level and gave a result of their correlation relationships, and used these relationships to implement our selected Supervised Learning models. We generated clear figures and summarised clear tables to compare the performance of different models.
  
  \item We designed some special situation models where policy-makers could have a clear insight that now is the time to take action to control the global temperature and reduce the excessive greenhouse effect.
  
  \item We create open source web page including Shiny App~\footnote{Shiny App: \href{https://grouporangearcticiceextent.shinyapps.io/shiny/?_ga=2.114418575.940438834.1607903962-2063170584.1607903962}{https://grouporangearcticiceextent.shinyapps.io/shiny/?_ga=2.114418575.940438834.1607903962-2063170584.1607903962}} and GitHub~\footnote{GitHub: \href{https://github.com/UCL-BENV0091-Antarctic}{https://github.com/UCL-BENV0091-Antarctic}}.
