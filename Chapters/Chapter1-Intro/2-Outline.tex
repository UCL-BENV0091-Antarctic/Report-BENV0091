This thesis consists of two parts --- \sys{Part I Environmental Risks in Supervised Learning: Foundations} and \sys{Part II Scenario: Predicting Arctic Sea Ice in Supervised Learning}.

\sys{Part I} focuses on the task of understanding and building Machine Learning processing flow, including processing to tidy data, so that we are able to predict Arctic sea ice in \sys{Part II}.

    \item In Chapter~\ref{Chapter2:Review}, we first give an overview of the history and recent development of the field of environmental risks, especially predicting sea ice in Arctic or ice sheets in Antarctic with Machine Learning. Next we formally define the problem ... and its main categories. We then briefly discuss ....  Finally, we argue ....
    \item In Chapter~\ref{Chapter3:Method}, we present the ..... We begin with describing .... We then introduce ... and we describe ....
