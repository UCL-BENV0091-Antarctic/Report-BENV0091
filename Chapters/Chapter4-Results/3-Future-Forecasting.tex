\section{Sea Ice Future Forecasting} %4.3

\subsection{Normal Situation} %4.3.1

Applying data sets which contains features for prediction (mentioned in part 3.6.1), the Arctic Sea Ice Extent variation in 10 years (from 2021 to 2030) can be plotted.

As the monthly **FIGURE** shows, the sea ice extent fluctuation conforms to the expected seasonality and continues the main trend. Therefore, we can judge that the prediction based on the neural network and the prediction data set is reasonable.

To see the long-term trend, it is more intuitive to visualise using annual averages. It can be seen that based on Random Forest model prediction, the Arctic sea ice extent decreased from 10.00 $\text{Mkm}^2$ in 2020 to 9.41 $\text{Mkm}^2$ in 2030, the extent reduced by 5.9\%.
