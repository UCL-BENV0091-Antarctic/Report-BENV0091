\section{Model Accuracy} %3.4

In this research, Mean Squared Error function (MSE) is used to test the model accuracy.

The Mean Squared Error function is generally used to detect the deviation between the predicted value of the model and the true value.

The training set: 
$$\text{Train = } \{({x_{1}},{y_{1}}),({x_{2}},{y_{2}}),\ldots,({x_{n}},{y_{n}}),\ldots,({x_{N}},{y_{N}})\}$$

N is the total amount of the training set, n = 1,2,...,N

The testing set:
$$\text{Test = } \{({x_{1}},{y_{1}}),({x_{2}},{y_{2}}),\ldots,({x_{m}},{y_{m}}),\ldots,({x_{M}},{y_{M}})\}$$

M is the total amount of the testing set, m = 1,2,...,M

Predicted value (Estimated value):  
$${\hat y} = \{{\hat {y_{2}}},{\hat {y_{2}}},\ldots,{\hat {y_{m}}},\ldots,{\hat {y_{M}}}\}$$

Then,

$${\displaystyle \operatorname {MSE} ={\frac {1}{M}}\sum _{m=1}^{M}(y_{m}-{\hat {y_{m}}})^{2}}$$

MSE is the expectation of the square of the difference between the real value and the estimated value. If MSE is large, then the prediction effect is bad.
