\section{Correlation Matrix} %3.1

The correlation matrix is a symmetric matrix. It is a table, which shows correlation coefficients between different variables. It could be used to summarise data, as an input into a more advanced analysis, and as a diagnostic for advanced analyses. The cells in the table indicate the correlation between two variables.

The Pearson's correlation coefficient is the most common correlation coefficient in the correlation matrix. It compares two interval variables or ratio variables. In the correlation matrix, it is also common to use Spearman’s Correlation and Kendall’s Tau-b.
