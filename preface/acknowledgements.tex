A special thanks to Prof. Aidan O'Sullivan and Thomas Falconer. They always have a very insightful, high-level view of the field while they are also uncommonly detail oriented and understands the nature of the problems very well. More importantly, they are extremely caring and supportive for both the module BENV0091: Energy Data Analysis and the module BENV0094: Statistics for Energy Analytics that we could not have asked for more.

Collaboration is a valuable lesson that we have learnt, which is also a precious part of our graduate stage. We thank each group member for the hardworking and collaboration. We are glad that our project topic is different from any other group project in this academic year. But most importantly, we hope it can inspire future research in the area of energy, environment, and any other related discipline. It was a very unique and rewarding experience for us.
